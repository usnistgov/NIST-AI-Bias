# NIST Open-Source Software Repository Template

This is the recommended template for NIST employees to use for new
open-source software repositories. 

### README

1. Software or Data description (Coming soon)
   - Statements of purpose and maturity
   - Technical installation instructions
2. Contact information (Coming soon)
   - PI name, NIST OU, Division, and Group names
   - Contact email address at NIST
   - Details of mailing lists, chatrooms, and discussion forums,
     where applicable
3. Related Material (Coming soon)
   - URL for associated project on <nist.gov> or other Department of
     Commerce site, if available
   - References to user guides if stored outside of GitHub
4. Directions on appropriate citation with example text (Coming soon)
5. References to any included non-public domain software modules, and
   additional license language if needed, *e.g.* [BSD][li-bsd],
   [GPL][li-gpl], or [MIT][li-mit] (Coming soon)

### Terms of Use: `LICENSE.md`

Each repository will contain a file named `LICENSE.md` that is
phrased in compliance with the Public Access to NIST Research
[*Copyright, Fair Use, and Licensing Statement for SRD, Data, and
Software*][nist-open].

- See [LICENSE.md](LICENSE.md).
### CODEOWNERS

This template repository includes a file named [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS),
which visitors can view to discover which GitHub users are "in charge"
of the repository.
More crucially, GitHub uses it to assign reviewers on pull requests.
GitHub documents the file (and how to write one) [here][gh-cdo].

***Please update this file*** to point to your own account or team,
so that the [Open-Source Team][gh-ost] doesn't get spammed with
spurious review requests. *Thanks!*

### Repository Metadata: `CODEMETA.yaml`

This repository includes a file named `CODEMETA.yaml`, used by the NIST
Software Portal to sort your work under the appropriate thematic
homepage. ***Please update this file*** with the appropriate "theme" and
"category" for your code/data/software. The Tier 1 themes are:

- [Information Technology](https://www.nist.gov/information-technology)
- [Standards](https://www.nist.gov/standards)
